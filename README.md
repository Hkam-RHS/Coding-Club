About this Repository
======

This repository is for the Roosevelt High School coding club. The purpose of these files is to provide quick-start layouts for the Intermediate level students.

Instructions for use.
======
1. Allow the students to download the files locally on their flash drives.
2. Have the students install caret for chrome. [Link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/caret/fljalecfjciodhpcledpamjachpmelml?hl=en)
3. Tell the students to load the samples in Google Chrome.
4. Allow the students to switch in between code view and browser view. Let them make connections on where things are.
5. Have them add their name to the top of the page somewhere. Save it. Then have the refresh the browser window.
6. Have them enter more text.
7. Show the students that code has open and closing tags.
8. Show them how to add links to another website.
9. Show them how to add images. Don't forget to remind them that images have unqiue extensions. Also, it would be more helpful for them to save the image to their flash drives rather than link it directly.

Goal
======
The goal of this project is for students to learn how to code like professionals.

During the process
======
Walk around and help students debug their code. Often times it is a simple syntax error.
